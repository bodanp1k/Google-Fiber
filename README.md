# Google-Fiber Customer Service Calls Analysis
A capstone project for the Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate.

This project's aim was to build an interactive [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bodan.pavlovski/viz/GoogleFiber_17242243380670/Story1) for Google Fiber's customer service team to monitor and analyze repeat call trends. 
The goal is to improve customer satisfaction by identifying the primary reasons behind repeat calls, thereby helping reduce call volume and optimizing operations. The data was processed using an ETL pipeline in PostgreSQL and later exported to Tableau, where the dashboard was prepared and shared.



To ensure that the big-picture project requirements were captured, three comprehensive BI documents guided the planning process:

1. **Stakeholder Requirements Document**: Captures stakeholder needs, defining the business problem and key requirements as the foundation for planning.

2. **Project Requirements Document**: Expands on stakeholder needs, outlining the project’s purpose, success criteria, and rollout plan for execution.

3. **Strategy Document**: Finalizes metrics, charts, and dashboard functionality, aligning stakeholders before development begins.

## Key Questions:
- How often does the customer service team receive repeat calls from customers?
- What problem types generate the most repeat calls?
- Which market city’s customer service team receives the most repeat calls?
